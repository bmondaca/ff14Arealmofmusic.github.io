        <h2>A Realm Reborn not Forgotten</h2>
        <article>
            Final Fantasy 14, released on september 30, 2010, was a game that was much anticipated by the fans of the FF series and off MMOs alike. Sadly, this game would not meet the expectations of many adventurers, and thus begane the downfall of FF14.
            On November 11, 2012, Square Enix officially shutdown the FF14 servers in a very impressive way. Literally usuring in the next calamaity, thus practicly ending the world of FF14, but that would not be the last of this game for the great Naoki Yoshida 
            had other plans. From the ashes of calamity, he recreated the realm and thus was a realm reborn and it was glorious. This is just a small piece of the story when it comes to the rebirth of FF14 but lets get to music why wont we. Its the best part anyways.
